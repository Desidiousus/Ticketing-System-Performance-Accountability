The best way to view our performance logs:
	1) Download IfranViewer
	2) set IfranViewer as default app for .png files
	3) Go to Options -> Properties/Settings - > Browsing/ Editing
	4) Click 'Loop current folder' radial box, under "If the end/begin of the folder is reached (during browsing)"
	5) Click OK

Everytime you open a TicketQueueScreenShot.png, do the following:
	1) Press cntrl + 'h' to zoom to 100% in IfranView
	2) Press shift + 'l' to lock the zoom to 100% while cycling through images

This allows you to easily navigate through all of the screen shots collected throughout the day, only using the arrow keys with the zoom fixed on 100%.

Left arrow descents down the list of Screenshots, right ascends the list chronologically.
